# Hypermnesia

Hypermnesia is a lightweight, smart flashcards app written in Python!


## Setup & Features
No dependencies required yet! Hypermnesia is current CLI-only and everything is done using the Python standard library.
```py
git clone https://github.com/ThatNerdSquared/hypermnesia.git
cd hypermnesia
python3 cli.py -h
```

- Hypermnesia creates decks (`.hypermnesia.json` files ) from `.csv` files. Pass one in using the `-c` flag.
- Run a practice session using the `-r` flag.
- Scramble the deck in a practice session using the `-s` flag.

## Future Plans
- [ ] Add information about success/failure rate per card into deck file
- [ ] Add smarter reshuffling based on success/failure rate
- [ ] Add deck stats
- [ ] Add basic GUI
- [ ] Add deck stats graphs in GUI
